November 1, 2023. 11AM to 5PM ET

Welcome! In this session, we will be exploring two common gems:

* [hyrax-doi](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyrax-doi) the Hyrax plugin for working with DOIs (model attributes, minting, and fetching descriptive metadata) via integration with DataCite
* [blacklight_oai_provider plugin](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight_oai_provider) which uses the [ruby-oai](https://github.com/code4lib/ruby-oai) gem to set up and configure OAI

## Basic Instructions
See [Running the stack](https://github.com/scientist-softserv/softserv-training-workshops-2023#running-the-stack) for setup directions if necessary. It is assumed that you have a running dev environment prior to beginning these exercises. 

For your actual work, please checkout and make a branch off of main, or continue on a branch from a previous workshop. If working from a previous session branch, be sure to pull and merge in `main` to bring in any updates.

You can use this branch as a working example, to check your progress as you work through the exercises.

## OAI
### OAI Goals
* Develop understanding of OAI, core concepts, providing and ingesting OAI with the blacklight_oai_provider gem
* How to install and utilize the OAI gem
### OAI Concepts
#### Introduction
[OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting)](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) is a mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers expose structured metadata, which can be harvested via requests. The OAI-PMH specification describes the 6 verbs which are used to make the data requests, the XML schema for the responses, and the underlying data model.

#### OAI Verbs
1. Identify - `verb=Identify` gives basic information about the OAI 
2. ListRecords - `verb=ListRecords` provides a paginated list of records in the repository, with a `resumption token` to access the next or prior pages. Requires a **metadata prefix**. 
3. ListSets - `verb=ListSets` lists all sets which are defined. A specific set can be included to limit the response of a ListRecords request.
4. ListMetadataFormats - `verb=ListMetadataFormats` lists all metadata formats which are defined. 
5. ListIdentifiers - `verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix=oai_dc` provides a paginated list of identifiers in the repository. Requires a **metadata prefix**.
6. GetRecord - `verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier={your identifier}` used to retrieve an individual metadata record from a repository. Requires an **identifier** and a **metadata prefix**.

#### OAI in Hyku
The OAI gem allows us to provides the data from the Hyku repository. It is included in Hyku with a basic configuration. Bulkrax is an example of a harvester, providing a way to harvest from a repository's OAI feed. 

OAI is included in hyku, via gems [blacklight_oai_provider](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight_oai_provider) and [ruby-oai](https://github.com/code4lib/ruby-oai), with the default configuration implementing the `oai_dc` metadataPrefix. The gem made the following Hyku app changes:

**CatalogController**
- include BlacklightOaiProvider::Controller
- config.oai = { }
  - defaults set in super admin console

**SolrDocument**
- include BlacklightOaiProvider::SolrDocument
- field_semantics.merge!( )

**Routes**
- concern :oai_provider, BlacklightOaiProvider::Routes.new
- under resource :catalog add concerns :oai_provider

The default url for OAI requests in Hyku is `{tenant url}/catalog/oai?` followed by the verb and other required arguments. This can be seen on a hyku app, without any additional configuration by using `verb=Identify`. An xsxlt document is used to display the results. Right-click and view page source to see the unformatted xml.

**Some simple customization points:**

- The number of items returned for a request can be modified in `catalog_controller.rb`
- New sets can be defined in `catalog_controller.rb` for any facetable terms. The pre-set configuration only defines sets for Admin Sets.
- Term mappings can be customized in `solr_document.rb`. Available terms for oai_dc are: `contributor`, `coverage`, `creator`, `date`, `description`, `format`, `identifier`, `language`, `publisher`, `relation`, `rights`, `source`, `subject`, `title`, `type`
- The `repository name`, `record prefix`, `admin email`, and `sample id` values used in the `catalog_controller` config can be configured individually by tenant in the app's superadmin dashboard.

#### Adding a new metadata format
Implementing a new metadataPrefix requires several oai gem overrides & customizations:

- Add `lib/oai/provider/metadata_format/xxxxxx.rb`, where `xxxxxx` is the new format being defined. Normally in `initialize` the array of terms is set as `@fields =`.
- Add (or update) `lib/oai/provider/model_decorator.rb` to define `map_xxxxxx`, the mapping from Hyku terms to the terms specified in @fields, for the new metadataPrefix.
- Update `application.rb` to require & load the new oai files:
```
# OAI additions
Dir.glob(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "../lib/oai/**/*.rb")).sort.each do |c|
  Rails.configuration.cache_classes ? require(c) : load(c)
end
```
- Add (or update) `lib/oai/provider/response/list_metadata_formats_decorator.rb` to include `prefix == xxxxxx`

#### Implementing a mods metadataPrefix
Implementing `mods` metadataPrefix varies somewhat from the above steps, as the oai gems do not define the xml so that needs to be added.

Differences from the above-described steps include:

- Do not define @fields in `mods.rb`. Instead, define a method encode which will replace the field definitions as well as the mappings normally done in `model_decorator.rb`:
```
# Override to strip namespace and header out
def encode(model, record)
  record.to_oai_mods
end
```
- Add `app/model/concerns/mods_solr_document.rb` which defines `to_oai_mods` and returns the mods xml document for the object.

### OAI Exercises
1. Access your oai_dc feed
2. Change the name of your oai_hyku prefix
3. Add a field or update a field name in your oai_hyku feed
4. Implement a new set
5. Bonus: implement a new metadata format

## DOI
### DOI Goals
* Develop understanding of DOI, how it is used, providers, registrations, resolvers, and updating DOI with the hyrax-doi gem
* Install and utilize the DOI gem in your application
